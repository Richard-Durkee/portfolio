I used a technique I learned in an UI/UX course, dividing a notebook page into 9 small sections, and spending no longer than one minute sketching in each section. I tried to think outside the box as much as possible -- when brainstorming, I believe quantity can come over quality, because if you are not willing to consider unorthodox solutions, you might miss the best solution.",
