Our objective was to revamp the companyâ€™s content organization and navigation to enhance user experience and better showcase content. Essentially, we aimed to redesign their user flow. Following receipt of the brief, we convened to analyze the current implementation of DriverAI's user flow, depicted below. Subsequently, we formulated clarifying questions for the founding engineer, focusing on the purpose of each organizational level (Workspace, Codebase, and Dashboard), key user features, and identification of main pain points in the current system.",

One crucial observation we made was regarding the structure of DriverAI's main page layers: the Dashboard, Workspaces, and Codebases. We identified a significant barrier between the initial landing point and the core content, which prompted our primary focus on simplifying the user experience and reducing the number of clicks required to access essential information. To address this issue, we decided to implement two key features derived from our sketches: Removal of the Workspaces level and integration of its functionality within the top level of the website.",
